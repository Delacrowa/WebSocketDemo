        Tips:
        <br/>
        - There are weapons on the ground you can pick up. 
        <br/>
        - Killing enemies will drop their weapons.
         <br/>
        - You start with a basic sword, and can pick up a spear or a great sword.
         <br/>
        - Also the higher your score, the more LIFE STEAL you get, you will gain health when you damage enemies.
         <br/>
        - You can swap weapons instantly, use this to trick opponents.
         <br/>
        - When you are in a "get hurt" animation, you can dodge out of it early so don't get comboed!
         <br/>
        - You can also dodge to cancel the item pick up and respawn animations
         <br/>
        - Dealing damage increases your score based on the score of the enemy. Dealing the killing blow gives a lot of points.
        <br/>
        - Full screen browser so entire screen fits so that scroll wheel doesn't activate on middle click.
